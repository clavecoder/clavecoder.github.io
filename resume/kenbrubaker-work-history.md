## Fiserv, Insurance Solutions Division (Financial Services)

> Cedar Rapids, IA
> http://www.fiservinsurance.com/
> July 2005 - January 2006
> Technical Team Lead (Contract)

Designed and led a six to nine person team to develop the calculation engine of an insurance regulatory filing product, eFreedom Annual Statement. Effort was a ground-up rewrite of the flagship product for the market leader. The system was developed in C#. Design is based on the prototype I developed for the customer over a year prior. It is the product of nearly 3000 man-hours of work over the last six months. The calculation engine is the most complex system I have developed to date.

It employs grammar-based parsing technology using Visual Parse++ and CodeDom code generation technique to develop a bottom-up, always in-sync, calculation engine. The system creates a value dependency graph at design time and immediately calculates all dependant values of customer entered data, and persists them to the database. This is implemented within the context of a Windows Forms-based smart-client and ASP.NET Web Services architecture. Client machines automatically calculate individual forms during editing while the web service maintains transactional integrity for value calculations in the multi user environment.

Key features include:

- Visual Parse++ context free grammars for both a legacy proprietary internal formula language and the validation formula language maintained by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). 
- Use of the .NET Framework CodeDom code generation technology to define a core scripting engine technology. This technology permits the engine to execute fully compiled scripts at high speed from multiple formula languages. 
- The formula language code generator produces formula details scripts that allows display and drill down into the intermediate values within the terms of the formula and permits hyperlinks to underlying values. This gives the accountant unprecedented visibility into formulas. 
- The formula details are displayed in an Excel-like formula language that I designed that will replace the legacy formula language. 
- The scripting technology enables both runtime execution of custom formulas and a managed automation library for the application. 
- This is a significant effort employing many developers over an extremely compressed schedule supporting an extremely complex business model with metadata for thousands of forms and hundreds of thousands of formulas.

The database framework, ADBQuery Database Framework (QFX), is a class library that provides an object-oriented interface to the Paradox database engine. QFX is a comprehensive class library that supports high-level database modeling, management, access, and manipulation operations. Key design features of the framework include the ability to perform mapping between business-model objects in memory and tables in the database. They also include the capability to carry out simplified record-oriented operations. 

The printing and reporting class framework implements all printing and reporting functionality in FW2000. The framework consists of a comprehensive set of classes that support formatted reports of object details, files, and summary information. 

The MS-Windows user-interface controls support virtualized viewing of database tables and large data lists. These controls solved major memory limitation problems inherent in MS-Windows list- and combo-boxes. 


Member of development team that built an MS-Windows based quality assurance tracking and planning application designed for the health-care industry. Designed and implemented database access and business-model infrastructure of the system. The application was written in Actor.

> Member Technical Staff (Permanent)

Participated in three development efforts. Gained expertise in testing procedures and in the MS-Windows architecture. 

Member of development team that developed the ObjectWindows application framework (OWL), a user-interface class library for MS-Windows. Whitewater developed OWL for Borland International, which included OWL as a significant part of its products Borland C++ with Application Frameworks and Turbo Pascal For Windows.

Developed test suite for testing ObjectWindows for C++ and Turbo Pascal. The test suite required development for both language platforms (i.e., written in C++ and Turbo Pascal). This was a major piece of work which tested all public interfaces to the class libraries. 

Member of team that designed and implemented a more limited database class library for Paradox database engine. The class library was written in C++. 

Produced test plan for public interface and trained personnel in the testing procedures I developed. 


Member of team that ported ObjectGraphics class library to Borland C++. ObjectGraphics is an object-oriented graphics class library for MS-Windows.
