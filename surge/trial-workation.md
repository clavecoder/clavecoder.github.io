# Trial Workation Retrospective

Kenneth Brubaker
*Friday, May 19, 2017*

## Introduction

On Friday, April 28th through Tuesday, May 2nd, our family made a trial
“workation” trip to Helen, GA, a local vacation spot about an hour's
drive from our home. Our purpose, besides getting a little relaxation,
was to try out the concept of a working vacation which was enabled by my
recent employment as a contractor with with Surge, LLC. Surge is an on-shore
outsourcing company where I work full time out of my home. “Home”, then
can be anywhere I can have a fast, reliable internet connection and can
work at a sustained high level.

To enable mobile development, I have purchased a number of components
for a mobile office. These components are detailed in my **Medium** blog
post <a href="https://medium.com/@kenbrubaker/my-mobile-office-2a1c634d1089" target="_blank">My Mobile Office</a>.

During the trip, I had a one-on-one meeting with Donovan, one the
management staff at Surge. He asked me to write up a retrospective of my
experience.

## Criteria

The following criteria are used to evaluate the experience:

1. Quality of the purchased components
1. Identify any needed mobile office components
1. Evaluate internet connectivity
1. Evaluate how to improve both work and play effectiveness

Though the net cost of a workation is less than an unfunded vacation,
there's still considerable cost. The benefits must outweigh the costs to
make them feesable. Moreover, if work cannot be performed, then no amount
of quality time make a working vacation feesable.

## Things that went well

1. Almost all of the purchased components performed admirably. The
   evaluation of these can be read in the **My Mobile Office** blog post.
1. The Airbnb cabin rental was spacious and delightful and the process
   was smooth.
1. We stayed at a hotel the first two nights as the cabin was not available
   given how soon we rented to the date. The hotel experience went well
   and turned out to be a boon to my development work as I'll discuss later.
   The children especially enjoyed the indoor pool.
1. In the end, we had an enjoyable time and quality work was also done.

## Things that did not go well

1. I planned to leave very early in the morning so that we would be
   settled at the destination during normal work hours. This was partly
   because of the need to interact and concentrate, but partly also that
   I was unsure of the quality of the internet as we approached the foothills.

   But we left late, spent too much time and money at Walmart, and did
   not arrive until early afternoon, forcing me to take an important call
   on the road and making me unprepared for an afternoon status meeting.
1. Initially I was unable to test my code over the network. And given
   that I was working on a UI page, doing so was essential. At first, I
   was afraid that the connection speed was the problem. Neither the
   hotel's Wifi, nor my Verizon hotspot would work. I even drove home
   to finish the days tasks and stayed the night at our home, despairing
   of vacationing with my family. However I found that the situation was
   not much better at home. That only marginally made me feel better. I
   did, however, return the next day, and found that the performance was
   better in the Hotel's conference center than either in the hotel room
   or at home! In fact, the generous hosts allowed me to return to work
   there while we stayed at the cabin. In the end, the issue was latency,
   not connection speed.
1. I was chagrined to find that my expensive and wonderful Bose noise
   cancelling headphones were useless on a conference call. I subsequently
   bought a wireless headset.
1. The cabin had no desk and it was uncomfortable working at the kitchen
   table with the kitchen chairs over a long period of time. I determined
   to purchase a portable desk and office chair, if possible. Read the blog
   post to see the result of that decision. I also felt I needed a lamp
   to work during evening hours, something I'd want to do frequently to
   maximize family time. Though it took some time, I was able to find a
   suitable lamp, which you can also read about in the blog post.

## Things we can improve

1. It's critical to plan and execute travel time to maximal effect.
   Certainly our performance as a travelling family will improve with
   experience. But we also purchased equally sized luggage that we can
   quickly load and unload. To minimize the need to shop at the last minute,
   we also purchased a several sturdy insulated bags from Sam's Club to
   keep our food cold on the go.

   My aim has been to keep driving time to under eight hours per day and
   only work on the road on a well traveled interstate highway.
1. It's critical to plan around scheduled meeting times: to make sure it
   occurs with adequate prep time and in quiet surroundings.
1. Consider availability of business oriented venues such as shared
   office space or hotel conference centers to provide adequate internet
   connectivity.

## Conclusion

We squeezed this trip in at a nearby location so that we could be
prepared for our first working vacation trip to Pennsylvania for the
annual family reunion over the Memorial Day weekend. We'll be taking
along some added mobile office components, but we will also be taking
along these lessons learned for a, hopefully, even more profitable
workation experience.
