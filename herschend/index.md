## Executive Summary

- Introduction
  - Author shares misgivings about preparing an analysis with so little
    information
  - A new software architecture is needed to capture the opportunities
    provided and challenges posed by the next decade.
  - A Director of Enterprise Web Applications provides hub around which
    to develop and deliver that architecture.

## Caveat

I've been asked by Jon Dilly at iStaff to provide an analysis of the
Director of Enterprise Web Architecture position at Herschend. I don't
feel very comfortable providing analysis with only a few hours worth of
conversation but with the caveat that my assessments may drastically
change as I learn more about Herschend and it's business, I will proceed
with what I feel may be a reasonable approach to the position.

## Introduction

### Entertainment in the 2020's

As we prepare to enter the third decade of the 21st century, Herschend
is poised to transform it's software architecture to better meet the
opportunities and challenges of a new connected reality.

Among Herschend's key demographics are youth and young adults with
children. In the 2020's, Millennials, who have grown up on the web
and Playstation, expect a connected entertainment experience. Even more,
the youth, children of Gen Xers such as myself, have come of age
immersed in world of ubiquitous connectivity through mobility. The world
of Instagram, Snapchat, and Pokéman Go. Both Millennials and Gen Xers
consider technology to be their most defining characteristic
([\[Pew14\]][Pew14] Figure 3.2). Catering to these demographics
require an increasingly connected entertainment experience.

Finally, interactive interaction with the customer provides
heightened engagement with the customer and guests that can provide
increased sales opportunities.

### The age of connected things

A similar trend is occurring in the world of machines and devices. With
Wi-Fi modules to be had for as little as $1 [\[GBMod\]][GBMod] no longer
should we consider machinery as merely mechanical or electrical systems.
Moreover, the prospect of connected devices provides unprecedented
opportunity for preventing and mitigating downtime of entertainment
and amusement center rides and providing more opportunities to delight
the guest.

### A new connected architecture

To meet the opportunities and challenges that Herschend faces in the
coming decade, a new distributed and connected architecture must be
envisioned and enacted using technologies and practices to which Herschend
has not been used in the past. A Director of Enterprise Web Architecture
provides a nexus around which to plan, construct, and deliver
distributed and connected software systems to meet the needs of the 2020's
